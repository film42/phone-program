So this was designed for the Donetsk Ukraine Mission. The purpose was to track calls from a monthly report. It established a hierarchy, and would flag calls that were longer than a certain duration, outside a certain day time interval, made outside the allowed hierarchy, or even malicious numbers. Made in like 7 days with little documentation. A lamp server was the only thing I had on my thumb drive so that's all I could use.
